### Views
1- `/dashboard` : In this view all the expenses that were had in the month are listed, there is a selection of dates. By default the expenses are ordered by date, but you can change it to sort them by total of the expense.

2- `/create` : In this view the expenses are created. There are required values such as description, amount and date. The amount also has to use a type value (D * .DD) (.cents).

3- `/` : This is the root of the app, used to login. If you do not have a session started you can not use the application.
